The Third Meal

## Project Summary
We want to create a website where customers can submit food orders for restaurants. The restaurant owners should be able to create and edit a profile and menus for their restaurants. Customers can create a profile for themselves. The customers should be able to browse the menu, place an order, and select how to pick up and pay for their orders. Once the order is placed, the restaurant owners can view, edit, and complete the order.
